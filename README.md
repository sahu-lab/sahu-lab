# Welcome

Welcome to the Sahu Lab's Github.
We are a theoretical laboratory in the [Chemical Engineering Department](https://che.utexas.edu/) at [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu).
We broadly focus on understanding various soft and living matter systems over many length and time scales.
In doing so, a motivating question arises:
How do microscopic interactions lead to emergent physics at mesoscopic or macroscopic scales?
<br>

To address this question, we bring together ideas from engineering, physics, computer science, and applied mathematics. For example:
- We use [statistical mechanical methods][statistical_mechanics] to describe equilibrium and non-equilibrium behavior over microscopic scales
- Our findings inform the [continuum mechanical descriptions][continuum_mechanics] of these same systems
- If classical techniques are intractable, we employ physics-based [machine learning methods][machine_learning]â€”which we require to satisfy the known physical laws governing the system of interest

Please see our [Lab Website](https://sahu-lab.github.io) to learn more.



## Numerical Methods

We frequently draw from the fields of [continuum mechanics][continuum_mechanics] ([fluid][fluid_mechanics] and [solid][solid_mechanics] mechanics), transport phenomena, [thermodynamics][thermodynamics], [statistical physics][statistical_mechanics], and electrodynamics.
In doing so, we formulate analytical theories and employ numerical methods---for example, the [finite element method][finite_element_method] and [molecular dynamics][molecular_dynamics] simulations.
We also develop physics-based [machine learning methods][machine_learning] that satisfy the appropriate balance laws and associated governing equations.

All of our numerical developments will be open-sourced and released here.
In the meantime, please [email Amaresh][email_amaresh] if you have further questions.
