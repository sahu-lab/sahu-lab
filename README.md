# Welcome

Welcome to the Sahu Lab's Github.
We are a theoretical laboratory in the [McKetta Department of Chemical Engineering](https://che.utexas.edu/) at [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu).
Our research group brings together ideas from engineering, physics, and applied mathematics to understand biology.
We are currently focused on describing the behavior of neurons, via theory and simulation.
Please see our [Lab Website](https://sahu-lab.github.io) to learn more.



## Numerical Methods

The Sahu Lab is currently focused on developing comprehensive models of neurons: fascinating entities involving the flux of various charged ionic species, internal and external fluid flows in response to osmotic imbalances, and structural support from the viscoelastic cytoskeleton.
To describe such phenomena, we draw from the fields of [continuum mechanics][continuum_mechanics] ([fluid][fluid_mechanics] and [solid][solid_mechanics] mechanics), transport phenomena, [thermodynamics][thermodynamics], [statistical physics][statistical_mechanics], and electrodynamics.
In doing so, we formulate analytical theories and employ numerical methods---for example, the [finite element method][finite_element_method] and [molecular dynamics][molecular_dynamics] simulations.
All of our numerical developments will be open-sourced and released here.
In the mean time, please [email Amaresh][email_amaresh] if you have further questions.
